\subsection*{What is this package?}

Font Awesome 5 Java\+Script packages support Type\+Script. This package abstracts out some of the common definitions that those packages use.

If you are trying to import types from this package we {\itshape highly} recommend you do the following instead as {\itshape all types in this package are re-\/exported to the main fontawesome package}.

your.\+ts

\`{}\`{}\`{} import \{ Icon\+Name \} from {\ttfamily @fortawesome/fontawesome}

const my\+Icon\+: Icon\+Name = \char`\"{}...\char`\"{} \`{}\`{}\`{}
